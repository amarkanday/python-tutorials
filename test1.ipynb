    "Creating a Python test to assess data analysis and modeling skills for a Staff Data Scientist position involves designing questions that evaluate a candidate's ability to work with data, perform analysis, and build predictive models. Here’s a sample test consisting of various tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Test for Data Analysis and Modeling Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "- You have 90 minutes to complete the test.\n",
    "- You may use any libraries or tools you are comfortable with.\n",
    "- Submit your code and a brief report summarizing your findings and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "You will work with a fictional retail dataset named `retail_data.csv`. It contains the following columns:\n",
    "- `order_id`: Unique identifier for each order\n",
    "- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer\n",
    "- `order_date`: Date when the order was placed\n",
    "- `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product\n",
    "- `quantity`: Number of items purchased\n",
    "- `price`: Price of each item\n",
    "- `category`: Category of the product (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Groceries)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning (20 minutes)**\n",
    "   - Load the dataset and check for missing values. Handle any missing data appropriately.\n",
    "   - Convert the `order_date` column to a datetime object and extract the year and month into new columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (30 minutes)**\n",
    "   - Generate summary statistics for numerical columns.\n",
    "   - Create visualizations to answer the following questions:\n",
    "     - What is the distribution of sales by product category?\n",
    "     - How do sales vary over time (monthly sales trend)?\n",
    "     - Identify the top 5 products by total sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering (15 minutes)**\n",
    "   - Create a new feature called `total_sales` which is calculated as `quantity * price`.\n",
    "   - Create any additional features that you think might be relevant for predicting future sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modeling (25 minutes)**\n",
    "   - Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).\n",
    "   - Build a regression model to predict `total_sales` based on the features you engineered.\n",
    "   - Evaluate your model using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R²).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reporting (Optional)**\n",
    "   - Provide a brief report (1-2 pages) summarizing your analysis, modeling approach, results, and any recommendations based on your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission\n",
    "- Submit your Python code as a Jupyter Notebook or Python script.\n",
    "- Include visualizations and a summary report in your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**: Appropriateness of handling missing values and data types.\n",
    "- **EDA**: Depth of analysis and quality of visualizations.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Creativity and relevance of features created.\n",
    "- **Modeling**: Correctness of the model, choice of algorithms, and evaluation metrics.\n",
    "- **Clarity of Reporting**: Ability to communicate findings clearly and effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- You may use libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.\n",
    "- Make sure your code is well-documented with comments explaining your thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This test provides a comprehensive evaluation of a candidate’s data analysis and modeling skills, relevant for a Staff Data Scientist role. Let me know if you need any modifications or additional details!"
