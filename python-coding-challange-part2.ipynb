    "To determine whether a coin is biased using a confidence interval, we can follow a statistical approach. The goal is to estimate the true probability of the coin landing on heads (or tails) and to construct a confidence interval around that estimate. If the confidence interval does not contain \\(0.5\\) (the probability of a fair coin), we can infer that the coin is biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect Data**:\n",
    "   - Flip the coin \\(n\\) times and record the number of heads \\(X\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Estimate the Probability**:\n",
    "   - Calculate the sample proportion of heads:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\hat{p} = \\frac{X}{n}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate the Standard Error (SE)**:\n",
    "   - The standard error for a proportion can be calculated as:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Determine the Confidence Level**:\n",
    "   - Choose a confidence level (e.g., 95%). The corresponding z-score for 95% confidence is approximately \\(1.96\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Construct the Confidence Interval**:\n",
    "   - Calculate the confidence interval using:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     CI = \\hat{p} \\pm z \\cdot SE\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Evaluate the Interval**:\n",
    "   - Check if the confidence interval includes \\(0.5\\):\n",
    "     - If it does, the coin is not statistically biased.\n",
    "     - If it does not, the coin is biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Implementation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you could implement this algorithm in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import scipy.stats as stats\n",
    "\n",
    "def coin_bias_test(flips, heads):\n",
    "    n = flips  # Total number of flips\n",
    "    X = heads  # Number of heads observed\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 2: Estimate the probability\n",
    "    p_hat = X / n\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 3: Calculate the Standard Error\n",
    "    SE = np.sqrt(p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / n)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 4: Determine the z-score for a 95% confidence level\n",
    "    z = stats.norm.ppf(0.975)  # For a two-tailed test\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 5: Construct the confidence interval\n",
    "    margin_of_error = z * SE\n",
    "    confidence_interval = (p_hat - margin_of_error, p_hat + margin_of_error)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 6: Evaluate the interval\n",
    "    biased = confidence_interval[0] > 0.5 or confidence_interval[1] < 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "    return confidence_interval, biased\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "flips = 100\n",
    "heads = 60\n",
    "confidence_interval, is_biased = coin_bias_test(flips, heads)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Confidence Interval: {confidence_interval}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Is the coin biased? {'Yes' if is_biased else 'No'}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Parameters**:\n",
    "   - `flips`: Total number of times the coin was flipped.\n",
    "   - `heads`: Total number of heads observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probability Estimation**:\n",
    "   - We compute the sample proportion of heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Error Calculation**:\n",
    "   - We calculate the standard error based on the sample proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Z-Score for Confidence Level**:\n",
    "   - We use `scipy.stats.norm.ppf()` to get the z-score corresponding to a 95% confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Confidence Interval Construction**:\n",
    "   - The margin of error is calculated, and the confidence interval is constructed around the sample proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bias Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - Finally, we check if \\(0.5\\) lies within the confidence interval to determine if the coin is biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this algorithm, you can determine whether a coin is biased or not based on the outcomes of multiple flips and the constructed confidence interval. Adjust the number of flips and observed heads to see how it affects the confidence interval and the bias evaluation."

    "   - `find_first_position()`: This function performs a binary search to locate the first occurrence of the target. It narrows down the search to the left half whenever it finds the target, allowing it to find the first index.\n",
    "   - `find_last_position()`: Similarly, this function performs a binary search to find the last occurrence of the target by narrowing down to the right half when it finds the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Function**:\n",
    "   - The `find_first_and_last_position()` function calls both position-finding functions and returns the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Usage**:\n",
    "   - In the example, we search for the target `8` in the array `[5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]`. The output will be:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     First position of 8: 3\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Single and double quotes\n",
    "single_quote_str = 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "double_quote_str = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Triple quotes for multi-line strings\n",
    "multi_line_str = \"\"\"This is a string\n",
    "that spans multiple lines.\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Accessing Characters in a String\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are indexed, allowing you to access individual characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"Hello\"\n",
    "first_char = s[0]  # 'H'\n",
    "last_char = s[-1]  # 'o'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. String Length\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the length of a string using the `len()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "length = len(s)  # 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. String Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several built-in string methods for common manipulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Changing Case**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  s = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "  print(s.lower())  # 'hello world'\n",
    "  print(s.upper())  # 'HELLO WORLD'\n",
    "  print(s.title())  # 'Hello World'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stripping Whitespace**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  s = \"   Hello, World!   \"\n",
    "  print(s.strip())  # 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Finding Substrings**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  index = s.find(\"World\")  # 7 (returns the starting index)\n",
    "  not_found = s.find(\"Python\")  # -1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replacing Substrings**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  new_s = s.replace(\"World\", \"Python\")  # '   Hello, Python!   '\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Splitting and Joining Strings**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  words = s.split(\", \")  # ['   Hello', 'World!   ']\n",
    "  joined = \", \".join(words)  # '   Hello, World!   '\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. String Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "You can format strings using f-strings (Python 3.6+), the `str.format()` method, or the `%` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using f-strings**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "  age = 30\n",
    "  formatted_str = f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\"\n",

    "  ```python\n",
    "  formatted_str = \"My name is %s and I am %d years old.\" % (name, age)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Checking for Substrings\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if a substring exists in a string using the `in` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "contains_hello = \"Hello\" in s  # True\n",
    "contains_python = \"Python\" in s  # False\n",
    "print(contains_python)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Reversing a String\n",
    "\n",
    "You can reverse a string using slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"Hello\"\n",
    "reversed_s = s[::-1]  # 'olleH'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Counting Occurrences\n",
    "\n",
    "You can count how many times a substring appears in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"Hello, Hello, World!\"\n",
    "count = s.count(\"Hello\")  # 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Checking String Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if a string contains only digits, letters, or whitespace using methods like `isdigit()`, `isalpha()`, and `isspace()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s1 = \"12345\"\n",
    "s2 = \"Hello\"\n",
    "s3 = \"   \"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(s1.isdigit())  # True\n",
    "print(s2.isalpha())  # True\n",
    "print(s3.isspace())  # True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Example Use Case: String Reversal and Palindrome Check\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a small example demonstrating string reversal and checking for a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_palindrome(s):\n",
    "    s = s.lower().replace(\" \", \"\")  # Normalize the string\n",
    "    return s == s[::-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test the function\n",
    "test_str = \"A man a plan a canal Panama\"\n",
    "print(is_palindrome(test_str))  # Output: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's string manipulation capabilities are powerful and flexible, making it easy to handle and process textual data. By using the built-in string methods and understanding how to manipulate strings, you can efficiently perform a wide variety of tasks in your programs. Whether you are cleaning data, formatting output, or analyzing text, mastering string manipulation is essential for effective programming in Python."

    "\n",
    "merged = merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2)\n",
    "print(\"Merged sorted array:\", merged)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - We create an empty list `merged_array` to store the result.\n",
    "   - Two pointers, `i` and `j`, are initialized to zero to track the current index of `arr1` and `arr2`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Merging Process**:\n",
    "   - A `while` loop is used to compare the elements at the current indices of both arrays.\n",
    "   - The smaller element is appended to `merged_array`, and the corresponding pointer is incremented.\n",
    "   - This continues until we reach the end of either `arr1` or `arr2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Appending Remaining Elements**:\n",
    "   - After one of the arrays has been completely traversed, we use additional `while` loops to append any remaining elements from the other array to `merged_array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Result**:\n",
    "   - Finally, the merged sorted array is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Output\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input arrays `arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]` and `arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]`, the output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Merged sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This method efficiently merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array with a time complexity of \\(O(n + m)\\), where \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are the lengths of the two arrays. It is a straightforward implementation that can be utilized in various applications requiring the combination of sorted lists."

    "### Remove element from array \n",
    "\n",
    "To remove an element from an array (or list) in Python, you have several options depending on whether you want to remove the first occurrence of a value, all occurrences of a value, or remove an element by its index. Here are the different methods you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Remove the First Occurrence of a Value\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `remove()` method, which removes the first occurrence of the specified value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def remove_first_occurrence(arr, value):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        arr.remove(value)  # Removes the first occurrence of value\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(f\"{value} not found in the array.\")\n",
    "    return arr\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5]\n",
    "updated_nums = remove_first_occurrence(nums, 2)\n",
    "print(updated_nums)  # Output: [1, 3, 4, 2, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Remove All Occurrences of a Value\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the elements you want to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def remove_all_occurrences(arr, value):\n",
    "    return [x for x in arr if x != value]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5]\n",
    "updated_nums = remove_all_occurrences(nums, 2)\n",
    "print(updated_nums)  # Output: [1, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Remove an Element by Index\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `pop()` method to remove an element at a specific index. This method also returns the removed element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def remove_by_index(arr, index):\n",
    "    if index < 0 or index >= len(arr):\n",
    "        print(\"Index out of range.\")\n",
    "        return arr\n",

    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "updated_nums, removed = remove_by_index(nums, 2)\n",
    "print(updated_nums)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]\n",
    "print(\"Removed element:\", removed)  # Output: Removed element: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`remove(value)`**: Removes the first occurrence of the specified value.\n",
    "- **List comprehension**: Removes all occurrences of a specified value by creating a new list.\n",
    "- **`pop(index)`**: Removes an element by its index and returns the removed element.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes:\n",
    "- The `remove()` method raises a `ValueError` if the specified value is not found in the list.\n",
    "- The list comprehension creates a new list and does not modify the original list. If you want to modify the list in place, you need to assign the result back to the original list or use a loop to remove elements directly.\n",
    "- The `pop()` method raises an `IndexError` if the index is out of bounds.\n",

    "### Remove duplicates from sorted array \n",
    "\n",
    "To remove duplicates from a sorted array in Python, you can utilize a two-pointer approach. Since the array is sorted, duplicates will be adjacent to each other, making it efficient to overwrite duplicates in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach:\n",
    "1. **Initialize Pointers**: Use one pointer (`i`) to iterate through the array and another pointer (`j`) to track the position to write the next unique element.\n",
    "2. **Iterate Through the Array**: As you iterate, compare the current element with the previous unique element. If they are different, write the current element to the position pointed by `j` and increment `j`.\n",
    "3. **Return Result**: The first `j` elements in the array will represent the unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can implement this in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def remove_duplicates(nums):\n",
    "    if not nums:\n",
    "        return 0  # Return 0 for an empty array\n",
    "\n",
    "    j = 1  # Start from the second element\n",
    "    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n",
    "        if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:  # Compare with the previous element\n",
    "            nums[j] = nums[i]  # Write the unique element at index j\n",
    "            j += 1  # Increment the position for the next unique element\n",
    "\n",
    "    return j  # The new length of the array with unique elements\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n",
    "new_length = remove_duplicates(nums)\n",
    "print(\"Length of array after removing duplicates:\", new_length)\n",
    "print(\"Array after removing duplicates:\", nums[:new_length])  # Output the unique part of the array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Edge Case**: If the array is empty, return 0.\n",
    "2. **Two Pointers**: The outer loop iterates through the array starting from the second element. The inner condition checks if the current element is different from the last unique element.\n",
    "3. **Overwrite Duplicates**: When a unique element is found, it is written at the position pointed to by `j`, and `j` is incremented.\n",
    "4. **Return**: The function returns the count of unique elements, which is the new length of the array with unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "For the example input `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]`, the output will be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Length of array after removing duplicates: 5\n",
    "Array after removing duplicates: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method runs in \\(O(n)\\) time complexity and uses \\(O(1)\\) space complexity since it modifies the array in place.\n"

    "### Majority element \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the majority element in an array, we can define the majority element as the element that appears more than \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\) times, where \\( n \\) is the size of the array. There are several approaches to solve this problem, but one of the most efficient methods is the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**, which operates in linear time and uses constant space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works in two phases:\n",
    "1. **Candidate Selection**: Traverse through the array to find a potential majority candidate.\n",

    "print(\"Majority element:\", result)  # Output: Majority element: 3\n",
    "```\n",

    "   \n",
    "2. **Candidate Validation**: \n",
    "   - After determining the candidate, we count how many times it appears in the array.\n",
    "   - If it appears more than \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\) times, we return it as the majority element. If not, we return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(n) \\) since we traverse the array a couple of times.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(1) \\) because we are using a fixed amount of extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Cases\n",
    "1. Input: `[3, 2, 3]` ➔ Output: `3`\n",
    "2. Input: `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]` ➔ Output: `2`\n",
    "3. Input: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]` ➔ Output: `None` (if no majority exists).\n",

This problem can be solved in linear time, \\(O(n)\\), and uses constant space, \\(O(1)\\).\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Initial Setup**: We check if the `prices` list is empty and return `0` if so. We initialize `min_price` to infinity to ensure any price will be lower on the first comparison and `max_profit` to `0`.\n",
    "2. **Looping Through Prices**: For each price:\n",
    "   - We update the `min_price` if the current price is lower.\n",

    "1. **Using `index()` Method**:\n",
    "   - The `index()` method searches for the first occurrence of the value and returns its index.\n",
    "   - If the value is not present in the list, it raises a `ValueError`, which we catch to return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using a Loop**:\n",

    "\n",
    "To find the longest common prefix among a list of strings in Python, you can use several approaches. Here’s a commonly used method that involves vertical scanning, where you compare characters of the strings at each position.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach: Vertical Scanning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with the first string as the initial prefix.\n",
    "2. **Character Comparison**: Compare characters of the prefix with characters of the other strings at the same index.\n",

    "### Find a perfect number \n",
    "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors (1, 2, and 3) add up to 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a Python function to determine if a given integer \\( n \\) is a perfect number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_perfect_number(n):\n",
    "    if n <= 1:\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    \n",
    "    divisors_sum = 1\n",
    "    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n",
    "        if n % i == 0:\n",
    "            divisors_sum += i\n",
    "            if i != n // i:\n",
    "                divisors_sum += n // i\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return divisors_sum == n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Initial Check**: If \\( n \\) is 1 or less, it cannot be a perfect number.\n",
    "2. **Sum of Divisors**: Start with 1 (since 1 is a divisor of all positive integers) and loop from 2 to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\) to find the other divisors.\n",
    "   - If \\( i \\) divides \\( n \\), add both \\( i \\) and \\( \\frac{n}{i} \\) to the sum (if they are different).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "#### Explanation\n",
    "1. **Counting Occurrences**: We use a dictionary to count how many times each character appears in the string.\n",

    "Time series analysis is a powerful tool in data science for examining time-ordered data points. In Python, time series analysis is typically done with the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, and `scipy` libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. Here’s a basic outline of how to perform time series analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Import Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import statsmodels.api as sm\n",
    "from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller\n",
    "from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Load and Inspect Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Load your time series data, typically containing a date/time column and a corresponding value column.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Loading data with a DateTime index\n",
    "data = pd.read_csv('your_time_series_data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'], index_col='Date')\n",
    "print(data.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Visualize the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting the time series can help you understand trends, seasonality, and irregularities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\n",
    "plt.plot(data, label=\"Time Series Data\")\n",

    "plt.ylabel(\"Values\")\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Check for Stationarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationarity is a key concept in time series analysis. You can use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = adfuller(data['Value'])\n",
    "print(f'ADF Statistic: {result[0]}')\n",
    "print(f'p-value: {result[1]}')\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Build a Model (e.g., ARIMA)\n",
    "\n",
    "An ARIMA model is often used for time series forecasting. The `p`, `d`, and `q` parameters represent autoregression, differencing, and moving average, respectively.\n",

    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 8: Evaluate Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating your model can involve calculating error metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample example to calculate errors\n",
    "test = data[-10:]  # Assuming the last 10 points are for testing\n",
    "predictions = forecast[-10:]\n",
    "mae = mean_absolute_error(test, predictions)\n",
    "rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(test, predictions))\n",
    "print(f'MAE: {mae}, RMSE: {rmse}')\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Full Workflow Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import libraries and load data.\n",
    "2. Visualize data and check for stationarity.\n",
    "3. Perform differencing if necessary.\n",
    "4. Decompose the series to understand trend and seasonality.\n",
    "5. Build an ARIMA (or SARIMA, if seasonal) model.\n",
    "6. Forecast future values.\n",
    "7. Evaluate the model with metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Create DataFrame for Prophet\n",
    "data = pd.DataFrame({'ds': date_range, 'y': sales})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Modeling with Prophet**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize the Prophet model and fit it to the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialize the model with default parameters\n",
    "model = Prophet()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model\n",
    "model.fit(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Making a Forecast**\n",
    "\n",
    "To forecast future values, you need to create a dataframe with future dates. Prophet will use this to generate forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define the forecast horizon (e.g., 90 days into the future)\n",
    "future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=90)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make the forecast\n",
    "forecast = model.predict(future)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Visualizing the Forecast**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can visualize the forecast using Prophet’s built-in plotting function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "## Plot the forecast\n",
    "fig = model.plot(forecast)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Prophet Forecast\")\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"Date\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"Sales\")\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Plotting Forecast Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "Prophet provides a breakdown of the forecast into its components: trend, weekly seasonality, and yearly seasonality (if applicable). This can help understand the impact of each component on the forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Plot the forecast components\n",
    "fig2 = model.plot_components(forecast)\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Adding Covariates (External Regressors)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Prophet allows you to add additional regressors, such as promotions or economic indicators, as covariates. Let’s add a `promotion` variable as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Generate a synthetic promotion feature\n",
    "data['promotion'] = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add the covariate to the model\n",
    "model = Prophet()\n",
    "model.add_regressor('promotion')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model with the new covariate\n",
    "model.fit(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Forecast with future covariate data\n",
    "future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=90)\n",
    "future['promotion'] = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=len(future))  # Random promotions for future\n",
    "\n",
    "forecast = model.predict(future)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. **Evaluating the Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a separate test set, you can evaluate Prophet’s predictions by calculating metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error\n",
    "\n",
    "# Split data for train/test evaluation\n",
    "train_data = data.iloc[:-90]\n",
    "test_data = data.iloc[-90:]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model on the training set\n",
    "model.fit(train_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predict for the test period\n",
    "test_forecast = model.predict(pd.DataFrame({'ds': test_data['ds'], 'promotion': test_data['promotion']}))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate error metrics\n",
    "mae = mean_absolute_error(test_data['y'], test_forecast['yhat'])\n",
    "rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(test_data['y'], test_forecast['yhat']))\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"MAE: {mae}\")\n",
    "print(f\"RMSE: {rmse}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and prepare data** in a format Prophet can use.\n",
    "2. **Initialize and fit the Prophet model**.\n",
    "3. **Forecast future values**.\n",
    "4. **Visualize the forecast and components**.\n",
    "5. **Add covariates** to improve the model (optional).\n",
    "6. **Evaluate the model** with error metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a foundation for using Prophet in Python for time series forecasting, including using covariates to enhance predictions."

    "### A/B testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing is commonly used to compare two versions of a product, feature, or process to determine which performs better. In Python, you can perform A/B testing using statistical tests, such as a t-test or chi-square test, depending on the data type. Below is a comprehensive guide for running an A/B test in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Import Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import scipy.stats as stats\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Load and Inspect Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Load your dataset with `group` and `metric` columns, where:\n",
    "- `group` indicates whether a sample is in Group A or Group B.\n",
    "- `metric` contains the observed metric (e.g., conversion rate or click-through rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load data\n",
    "data = pd.read_csv(\"ab_test_data.csv\")\n",
    "print(data.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Get some basic descriptive statistics to understand the data distribution in each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Summary statistics by group\n",
    "summary = data.groupby('group')['metric'].describe()\n",
    "print(summary)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Visualize Data Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize the distribution of the metric in each group to better understand the variance and any potential skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Plot distributions\n",
    "sns.histplot(data[data['group'] == 'A']['metric'], kde=True, label=\"Group A\", color=\"blue\")\n",
    "sns.histplot(data[data['group'] == 'B']['metric'], kde=True, label=\"Group B\", color=\"red\")\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "plt.title(\"Distribution of Metric by Group\")\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"Metric\")\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Perform a t-test (for Continuous Metrics)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the metric is continuous (e.g., average order value or time spent), use an independent t-test to check if the means of the two groups are statistically different.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Separate data into two groups\n",
    "group_a = data[data['group'] == 'A']['metric']\n",
    "group_b = data[data['group'] == 'B']['metric']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform an independent t-test\n",
    "t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group_a, group_b)\n",
    "print(f\"T-statistic: {t_stat}\")\n",
    "print(f\"P-value: {p_value}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the **p-value is less than 0.05**, you can conclude there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Perform a Chi-Square Test (for Binary Metrics)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your metric is binary (e.g., conversion or no conversion), you can use a chi-square test to determine if there’s a significant difference in conversion rates between the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a contingency table** with counts of successes and failures in each group.\n",
    "2. **Run a chi-square test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a contingency table\n",
    "contingency_table = pd.crosstab(data['group'], data['metric'])\n",
    "print(contingency_table)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chi-square test\n",
    "chi2, p_value, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(contingency_table)\n",
    "print(f\"Chi-square statistic: {chi2}\")\n",
    "print(f\"P-value: {p_value}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, if the **p-value is less than 0.05**, you can conclude there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: Calculate Confidence Interval for Mean Difference (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the confidence interval for the difference between means can provide additional context on the effect size.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculate the mean difference and confidence interval\n",
    "mean_diff = group_b.mean() - group_a.mean()\n",
    "std_err_diff = np.sqrt(group_a.var()/len(group_a) + group_b.var()/len(group_b))\n",
    "conf_interval = stats.t.interval(0.95, len(group_a) + len(group_b) - 2, loc=mean_diff, scale=std_err_diff)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Mean Difference: {mean_diff}\")\n",
    "print(f\"95% Confidence Interval for Mean Difference: {conf_interval}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 8: Interpret Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P-value**: If the p-value is less than 0.05, the difference is statistically significant.\n",
    "- **Confidence Interval**: If the 95% confidence interval does not include 0, it suggests a meaningful difference in the metric between groups.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Full A/B Testing Workflow Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import libraries and load data**.\n",
    "2. **Explore data with descriptive statistics and visualizations**.\n",
    "3. **Choose and perform a statistical test** (t-test for continuous metrics, chi-square for binary metrics).\n",
    "4. **Calculate a confidence interval** to understand the effect size.\n",
    "5. **Interpret results** to decide if the observed differences are meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will provide a structured framework for running an A/B test in Python and drawing conclusions from your results."
