    "# Lead Data Scientist Python Test\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Allotment:** 90–120 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with a synthetic dataset (`ebay_data.csv`) that simulates user session data on eBay. The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **session_id:** Unique identifier for each session.\n",
    "- **user_id:** Unique identifier for each user.\n",
    "- **timestamp:** Timestamp of the event.\n",
    "- **action:** Type of action (e.g., \"view\", \"click\", \"add_to_cart\", \"purchase\").\n",
    "- **price:** Price of the item involved in the action.\n",
    "- **product_category:** Category of the product.\n",
    "- **purchase:** Binary indicator (0 or 1) showing whether a purchase occurred in the session (target variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a purchase (i.e., `purchase` = 1) given the session data. You will perform data loading, cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. There are also bonus questions to assess deeper insight and strategic thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Data:**  \n",
    "   - Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "   - Display the first few rows to understand the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning:**  \n",
    "   - Check for and handle missing values and outliers.\n",
    "   - Convert the `timestamp` column to a datetime object.\n",
    "   - Create additional time-based features (e.g., hour of day, day of week).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Summary Statistics:**  \n",
    "   - Compute descriptive statistics for numerical features.\n",
    "   - Examine the distribution of the target variable (`purchase`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visualization:**  \n",
    "   - Plot the distribution of key features (e.g., `price`).\n",
    "   - Visualize the relationship between features and the target variable (e.g., using box plots, histograms, or correlation matrices).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 3: Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Categorical Variables:**  \n",
    "   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., `action`, `product_category`) using one-hot encoding or another appropriate method.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Additional Features:**  \n",
    "   - Consider creating new features (e.g., session duration if multiple timestamps per session are available, user behavior metrics, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 4: Model Building\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train-Test Split:**  \n",
    "   - Split your data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Selection:**  \n",
    "   - Build at least one classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) to predict purchase behavior.\n",
    "   - Train your model on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation:**  \n",
    "   - Evaluate your model’s performance on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.\n",
    "   - Provide a confusion matrix and classification report.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 5: Model Evaluation and Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  \n",
    "   - Use cross-validation and GridSearchCV (or a similar approach) to optimize model hyperparameters\n"
