# Python Data Science Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of Python tutorials and exercises focused on data science, machine learning, and data analysis. The tutorials are designed to help you learn and practice various data science concepts through hands-on examples. Tests are modeled on what one would expect in a ML coding interview.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-tutorials.git
   cd python-tutorials
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Tutorials

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the `Tutorials/exercises` directory to find the tutorial notebooks.

## Tutorials Folder Structure

The `Tutorials/` directory is organized into 3 main subdirectories:

### 1. Core Tutorials (`Tutorials/core_tutorials/`)

This directory contains fundamental tutorials designed for beginners and those who need to refresh their knowledge. These tutorials provide a solid foundation before moving on to the more advanced exercises.


### 2. Exercises (`Tutorials/exercises/`)

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with hands-on exercises and practice problems. Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and includes:

- **Theory and Concepts**: Explanations of key concepts and algorithms
- **Code Examples**: Practical implementations with detailed comments
- **Practice Problems**: Exercises to reinforce learning
- **Data Loading**: Instructions for loading and preprocessing data
- **Visualization**: Examples of data visualization techniques
- **Model Building**: Step-by-step guides for building ML models
- **Evaluation**: Methods for evaluating model performance

The exercises progress from basic to advanced topics, allowing you to build your skills gradually.


### 3. Solutions (`Tutorials/solutions/`)

This directory contains completed solution notebooks for the exercises. The solutions include:

- **Complete Implementations**: Fully working code for all exercises
- **Alternative Approaches**: Different ways to solve the same problem
- **Best Practices**: Examples of efficient and clean code
- **Performance Optimizations**: Techniques for improving code efficiency
- **Explanations**: Detailed explanations of the solution approach

The solutions are provided as a reference after you've attempted the exercises yourself.
