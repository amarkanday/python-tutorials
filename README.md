2. **Machine Learning Implementation:**
   -    Building and evaluating models using libraries such as scikit-learn. 
   -    Implementing algorithms like k-means clustering and logistic regression.    

3. **Algorithmic Problem-Solving:**
   -    Solving problems related to sorting, searching, and optimization. 
   -    Writing functions to merge sorted lists or reconstruct sequences.    

4. **Data Structures:**
   -    Working with lists, dictionaries, sets, and understanding their time complexities. 

5. **Statistical Analysis:**
   -    Applying statistical methods to analyze data distributions and relationships. 

**Sample Python Questions:**

-    **Implement k-Means Clustering:** Write a Python function to perform k-means clustering on a given dataset without using external libraries.    

-    **Logistic Regression Model:** Develop a logistic regression model in Python to predict binary outcomes based on input features.   

-    **Merge Sorted Lists:** Given multiple sorted lists, write a function to merge them into a single sorted list without using built-in sort functions.    

-    **Data Transformation:** Using Pandas, transform a raw dataset into a structured format suitable for analysis, handling missing values and outliers appropriately. 

**Preparation Tips:**

-    **Review Core Python Concepts:** Ensure a strong understanding of Python fundamentals, including data structures, control flow, and error handling. 

-    **Practice Data Manipulation:** Work on exercises involving data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation using Pandas and NumPy.
