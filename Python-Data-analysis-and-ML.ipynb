    "## 7. Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In **supervised learning**, you train a model using labeled data, which means that each training example has a corresponding output. The model learns the relationship between input and output, and you can use it to predict the output for new, unseen data. Supervised learning is divided into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification**: Predict categorical outputs (e.g., classifying an email as spam or not spam).\n",
    "- **Regression**: Predict continuous outputs (e.g., predicting house prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 7.1: Linear Regression with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Regression** is a simple type of regression where the relationship between the input (independent) and output (dependent) variable is represented as a line. Below is an example using Python's popular machine learning library `scikit-learn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Code for Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",

    "# Generating synthetic dataset\n",
    "np.random.seed(0)\n",
    "X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)\n",
    "y = 4 + 3 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Splitting data into training and testing sets\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a Linear Regression model\n",
    "model = LinearRegression()\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Making predictions\n",
    "y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluating the model\n",
    "print(\"Mean Squared Error:\", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))\n",
    "print(\"R² Score:\", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Visualizing the results\n",
    "plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue', label='Data Points')\n",
    "plt.plot(X, model.predict(X), color='red', linewidth=2, label='Regression Line')\n",

    "plt.ylabel(\"y\")\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "1. **Data Generation**: We generated random data that fits the equation `y = 4 + 3*X + noise`.\n",
    "2. **Training the Model**: We use `train_test_split` to divide the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "3. **Model Training**: `LinearRegression()` is used to create the model, and `.fit()` trains it on the training data.\n",
    "4. **Prediction and Evaluation**: We evaluate using `mean_squared_error` and `r2_score`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how you can predict continuous values, like house prices, based on one or more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 7.2: Classification with Python (K-Nearest Neighbors)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Classification Problem** can be solved using algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Here, we'll classify whether a given iris flower belongs to a specific species based on its characteristics.\n",

    "accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "print(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "1. **Dataset**: The Iris dataset is a standard dataset for classification, containing flower measurements for three species.\n",
    "2. **Training the Model**: A KNN model is trained with `k=3`, which means we use the 3 nearest neighbors to classify a point.\n",

    "1. **Parameter Grid**: We define the `param_grid` with multiple values for `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `n_estimators`, `gamma`, and `subsample`.\n",
    "2. **GridSearchCV**: We use `GridSearchCV` to find the best combination of hyperparameters. Here, `cv=3` means we are using 3-fold cross-validation.\n",

    "1. **`max_depth`**: The maximum depth of a tree. Higher values might lead to overfitting.\n",
    "2. **`learning_rate`**: The step size to update weights in each iteration. Lower values make the model learn slowly.\n",
    "3. **`n_estimators`**: The number of boosting rounds.\n",
    "4. **`gamma`**: A regularization parameter. It controls whether a given leaf will split based on its gain.\n",
    "5. **`subsample`**: The proportion of training data that is randomly selected for each boosting round.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we have implemented a simple deep learning model for digit classification using both Keras and PyTorch, as well as an unsupervised learning example using scikit-learn. Keras provides a high-level interface that makes model building easy and quick, whereas PyTorch offers more control and flexibility, which is great for experimentation. Scikit-learn, on the other hand, is ideal for unsupervised learning tasks like clustering. Your choice of framework will depend on your project's requirements and objectives.\n",
